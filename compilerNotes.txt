A feature of most interpreted languages is an eval() function. THis function takes as input a string and returns the result of that string as if it were part of the script:

eval('1+1')                          returns 2
eval(console.log('Hello, world!'))   Logs 'Hello, World!'
eval(MALICIOUS CODE)                 DOES SOMETHING MALICIOUS

Eval() can be problematic in some cases and developing an alternative can be a fun exercise!

In this case, an alternative will take as input a STRING REPRESENTING A BOOLEAN EQUATION

It will be helpful to 'simplify' the equation. For example, the following are all valid:

1 and (0 or not 1 and 1)
1 && (0 || !1 && 1)
1 * (0 + !1 * 1)

all of these are equivalent and can be simplified using a tokenizer friendly shorthand by:
1 removing all whitespace
2 replacing operators with their single character equivalents

Carrying out these steps on any of the above examples will give:
1*(0+!1*1)

This will be useful as now all useable information is exactly one character long. THis will make T0KENIZING trivial.

A TOKENIZER (or LEXER) will break an input expression into its smallest useable parts and retrieve them
one at a time. In our case this just means iterating over all characters in the input string and returning
the current character

In this implementation, ach token has a TYPE and a LEXEME
The LEXEME is the character of the input string corresponding with the token
The TYPE gives more information about the token
Token types can be as follows:

BinaryConstant (0 or 1)
UnaryOperator (!)
BinaryOperator (*,+)
OpenParenthesis('(')
CloseParenthesis(')')
ENDOFFILE

PSEUDOCODE FOR TOKENIZER:

PRECONDITION: Input string is formatted as above
Set charIndex to 0

when asked to advance:
    return EOF Token if currentIndex >= input string length

    get input string character at charIndex
    store character as LEXEME
    get TYPE by referencing character against types above
    return a new token with (TYPE, LEXEME)
